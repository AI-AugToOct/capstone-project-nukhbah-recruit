"Welcome to the Software Engineer coding quiz for the education sector. We are excited to have you showcase your skills in this scenario-based challenge.\n\nScenario:\nYou are tasked with developing a feature for an educational platform that calculates the average score of students in a class. The system should take a list of scores as input and return the average score. The platform is built using Python and leverages the Flask framework for web development.\n\nYour task is to complete the following Python function that calculates the average score based on the input list of scores:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_score(scores):\n    if not scores:\n        return 0\n    \n    total_score = 0\n    for score in scores:\n        total_score += score\n    \n    average_score = total_score / len(scores)\n    \n    return average_score\n```\n\nPlease complete the `calculate_average_score` function to ensure it correctly calculates the average score. Assume that the input `scores` is a list of integers.\n\nFeel free to test your implementation with different sets of scores to ensure its accuracy.\n\nWe look forward to seeing your solution to this coding challenge and wish you the best of luck!"
