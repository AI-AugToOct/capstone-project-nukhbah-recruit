"Welcome to the technical coding quiz for the Software Engineer position at our education sector company. We are excited to have you showcase your skills in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, ReactJS, and more. \n\nScenario:\nYou are tasked with enhancing the user interface of our educational platform by implementing a feature that allows students to filter courses based on their level of difficulty. Your goal is to write a function in ReactJS that filters and displays courses according to the selected difficulty level. You need to ensure smooth integration with the backend APIs developed in Java and Spring Boot.\n\nCode Challenge:\nBelow is a partially completed React component that needs your expertise to implement the filtering logic. Your task is to complete the filterCourses function to filter courses based on the selected difficulty level and render them accordingly. Assume that the courses data is provided as an array of objects with each object containing the course details including its difficulty level.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst CoursesList = ({ courses }) => {\n  const [selectedDifficulty, setSelectedDifficulty] = useState('');\n\n  const filterCourses = () => {\n    // Implement filtering logic here based on selectedDifficulty\n    // Return the filtered courses array\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Available Courses</h2>\n      <select \n        value={selectedDifficulty}\n        onChange={(e) => setSelectedDifficulty(e.target.value)}\n      >\n        <option value=\"\">All Difficulty Levels</option>\n        <option value=\"beginner\">Beginner</option>\n        <option value=\"intermediate\">Intermediate</option>\n        <option value=\"advanced\">Advanced</option>\n      </select>\n      \n      <ul>\n        {filterCourses().map((course) => (\n          <li key={course.id}>{course.title} - {course.difficulty}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CoursesList;\n```\n\nClosing Message:\nWe are looking forward to seeing your problem-solving skills in action. Good luck with the coding challenge!"
