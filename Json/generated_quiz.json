"Welcome to the technical coding quiz for the Software Engineering position at our education sector company. We are excited to see your problem-solving skills in action!\n\nScenario:\nYou are tasked with developing a new feature for our education platform. The feature involves creating a RESTful API endpoint using Java and Spring Boot to retrieve a list of courses offered by the platform. Additionally, you need to ensure that the front-end React application can consume this API to display the course information to the users.\n\nInstructions:\nBelow is a partially implemented Java controller class for the course API endpoint. Your task is to complete the code snippet by adding the necessary method to fetch and return a list of courses. Remember to follow RESTful API conventions and handle any potential exceptions that may arise.\n\n```java\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/courses\")\npublic class CourseController {\n\n    // Your code goes here\n}\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The course data is stored in a database accessible via a service layer.\n- The endpoint should respond with a JSON array of course objects.\n- Assume the existence of a CourseService class with a method getCourses() that returns a list of Course objects.\n\nFeel free to demonstrate your expertise in Java and Spring Boot as you tackle this challenge. We look forward to seeing your solution!\n\n---\n\nWe are confident that your experience and skills will shine through in this coding quiz. Good luck, and we can't wait to review your solution!"
